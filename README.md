## Introduction

Artificial intelligence and bleeding-edge machine learning has become an integral part of the software engineering landscape in the past few years. 

Using powerful state-of-the-art open-source algorithms, we as software engineers and developers can integrate predictive technologies within our applications and services to bring unique and meaningful experiences to our users. 

## Summary

This project is a full-stack minimalist web app with the goal of integrating the Stable Diffusion model within a lightweight Python backend and a simple React frontend to allow users to produce AI-generated images.
